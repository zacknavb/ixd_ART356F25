    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hello, welcome to my game! This game is heavily inspired by Vampire Survivors and similar games and is my take on the genre fully using p5js and p5play.</p>
    <p>If you have never played Vampire Survivors or any other bullet heaven, you play by automatically attacking in the direction you're facing and defeating swarms of enemies.</p>
    <p>Enemies drop experience for you to collect which helps you level up! Each level allows you to upgrade any specific stat.</p>
    <p>Get stronger and defeat hordes of enemies until you either succumb to their numbers or survive till time runs out and claim victory!</p>
    <h2>Have Fun!</h2>
    <br>
	<h2>Controls</h2>
    <p>Movement: WASD or Arrow Keys</p>
    <p>Pause: Escape Key</p>
	<br>
    <h2>Debugging Controls</h2>
    <p>Turn on hitboxes: 1</p>
    <p>Turn off hitboxes: 2</p>
    <br>
    <p>The controls can be found within the game but here they are down here if you need them!</p>
